<h1 align="center">Backend Developer</h1>
## 👋 Hello! I'm Xurshid Abdumannonov

### 💻 Junior Backend Developer | PHP & Laravel Enthusiast

I am a self-taught backend developer specializing in PHP and Laravel. I love building efficient, scalable, and secure web applications that solve real-world problems. I follow best practices in clean code, architecture, and development workflows.

In addition to backend development, I pay close attention to frontend design and user experience, using tools like Tailwind CSS and Livewire to create dynamic, responsive interfaces that feel modern and intuitive.

I have hands-on experience working with real-time features using WebSockets and Pusher, allowing me to build interactive applications such as live notifications, chat systems, and real-time dashboards.

I’m also comfortable working in Linux environments, managing MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, and developing well-documented RESTful APIs for both web and mobile platforms.

I’m passionate about continuous learning, contributing to open-source, and collaborating on innovative projects that make an impact.
